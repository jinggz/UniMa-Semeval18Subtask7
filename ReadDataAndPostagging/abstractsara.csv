"1,""Oral communication is ubiquitous and carries important information yet it is also time consuming to document. Given the development of storage media and networks one could just record and store a conversation for documentation. The question is, however, how an interesting information piece would be found in a large database . Traditional information retrieval techniques use a histogram of keywords as the document representation but oral communication may offer additional indices such as the time and place of the rejoinder and the attendance. An alternative index could be the activity such as discussing, planning, informing, story-telling, etc. This paper addresses the problem of the automatic detection of those activities in meeting situation and everyday rejoinders. Several extensions of this basic idea are being discussed and/or evaluated: Similar to activities one can define subsets of larger database and detect those automatically which is shown on a large database of TV shows . Emotions and other indices such as the dominance distribution of speakers might be available on the surface and could be used directly. Despite the small size of the databases used some results about the effectiveness of these indices can be obtained. """
"2,"" To support engaging human users in robust, mixed-initiative speech dialogue interactions which reach beyond current capabilities in dialogue systems , the DARPA Communicator program [1] is funding the development of a distributed message-passing infrastructure for dialogue systems which all Communicator participants are using. In this presentation, we describe the features of and requirements for a genuinely useful software infrastructure for this purpose. """
